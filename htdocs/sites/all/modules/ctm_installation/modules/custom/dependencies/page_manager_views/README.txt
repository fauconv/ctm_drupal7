Page Manager Views
by Christian Vallebella (fauconv5)

Overview:
---------

Direct a URL to a vue (like TVI module) but is compatible with page manager
(ctools). And it is faster than all other redirect system from page manager
because there is no redirection. The view page is served directly.

This module is more powerfull than TVI because you can use all the "context"
system from page manager.

example :
---------

/taxonomy/term peut can be redirected to a views "A" if the term in url come
from a vocabulary "my voc" or to an other view if not.
